# What-Can-We-Learn-From-Our-Food

The dataset I analyze was obtained from Open Food Facts (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) - a free collaborative database of food products. Each product is uploaded by users who scan the food products and their nutrition labels. 

The dataset originally contained information on 356,027 food products from 224 different countries with 163 characteristics for each product. For my analysis, I wanted to use an organized and condensed dataset. __Check out how I cleaned and inspecting the [data quality here](https://github.com/indialindsay/What-Can-We-Learn-From-Our-Food/blob/master/Data%20Quality.ipynb)__
