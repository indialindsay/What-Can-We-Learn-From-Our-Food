# What-Can-We-Learn-From-Our-Food

The dataset I'll be analyzing contains 356,027 food products from around the world and 163 characteristics for each product. For this analysis, I focused in on the countries that had at least 1000 products. 

The data was obtained from Open Food Facts (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) - a free collaborative database of food products with each product uploaded by users who scan the food products and upload pictures of their nutrition labels. The data set contains a wide variety of information on each product ranging from the ingredients to allergens to nutrition facts, all gathered from the packaging labels.

## The file 'report' contains the final story comparing and contrasting how different countries eat.

Look at the 'Cleaning up the data' file to see how I imported and cleaned this dataset. See 'Nutrients by Country' to learn how I generated these plots :)
